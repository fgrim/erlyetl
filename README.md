Erlyetl is an Erlang-based Extract/Transform/Load system with transforms or stages written
in a number of different languages.  Presumably if you have found this you know what you 
are looking for.  However (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) provides 
a good intro to these systems.
